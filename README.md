# Snake Game

A classic Snake game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Navigate the snake to eat food and grow as long as possible without hitting the walls or itself.

## Features

- **Simple Controls**: Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
- **Scoring System**: Earn points by eating food; the more you eat, the higher your score.
- **Speed Increase**: The snake's speed increases slightly with every piece of food eaten, making the game progressively more challenging.
- **Special Food Items**: Occasionally, special food items appear that provide extra points or unique effects.
